# @5rabbits/create-react-lib

Create a react library with no configuration, based on 5rabbits standards.

## Usage

* Execute `yarn create @5rabbits/react-lib <lib-name>`. For example, `yarn create @5rabbits/react-lib super-input`.
* The library will ask you a few questions to setup the git project, readme and npm publications (nothing will be pushed/published automatically):
  - The npm organization name that will namespace the package. For example, this package is namespaced with the organization `5rabbits` (resulting in packages named like `@5rabbits/*`).
  - The github repository where you will host the new library.
* This will create the directory `super-input` with the entire project structure, ready to start developing your new library.
* Follow the onscreen instructions.
